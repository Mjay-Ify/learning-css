    <p>A healthy breakfast is a nutritious and balanced meal that provides your body with the essential nutrients it needs to kickstart your day. Typically, 
        it includes a combination of whole grains, protein, healthy fats, and fruits or vegetables.</p>
        <p>Whole grains, such as oatmeal or whole wheat bread, offer complex carbohydrates for sustained energy throughout the morning. Protein sources like eggs, 
        Greek yogurt, or lean meats help with muscle repair and satiety. Healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts, or seeds contribute to overall well-being and cognitive function.

        Adding fruits or vegetables to your breakfast provides vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, promoting overall health. Hydration is also essential, so starting your day with a glass of water or herbal tea is a good practice.</p>
